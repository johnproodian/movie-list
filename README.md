# Bootcamp Project 2: Interactive Full Stack Project  // Movie List

This project, Movie List, is an interactive full stack project for Project 2 of our bootcamp. It's an app that allows you to host an archive of movies you would like to watch as well as movies that you have already watched.  

The idea for this project came from the discussions we often have... where someone says "Hey have you seen <movie>?" and you have to respond with "Not yet, but it's on my list!"  

Now this metaphorical list exists!

## User Story

```
As a USER, I'd like to create an account to save my info on Movie-List.
Once logged in, I want to search for movies and add them to my list of movies to watch.
Once I've watched a movie, I'd want to move it over to the columns of movies that I have watched.
As a USER, I want to be able to log out to protect my privacy.
```
## Note on Usage

At its current stage of development, the movies that the user may search for and add to their 'WILL WATCH' list are confined to those in our database, namely:

* Forrest Gump
* Mean Girls
* A New Hope
* Spaceballs
* The Fifth Element
* Death Becomes Her
* The Breakfast Club
* Clueless
* The Wedding Singer
* 10 Things I Hate About You
* Scream
* Twister

Movies may be added to the 'WILL WATCH' column by searching for them in the search bar on the home page. 

Then, clicking on the movie in the WILL WATCH column will move it to the 'HAVE WATCHED' column.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.  
Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.  
Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.  
Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.  
Be deployed using Heroku (with data).  
Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.  
Have a polished UI.  
Be responsive.  
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).  
Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.  
Include authentication (express-session and cookies).  
Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.  
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).  
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
